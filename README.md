# GenAI Marketing Copilot 

### Purpose
A creative co-pilot that helps marketers generate campaign ideas, A/B test variants, and tailor messaging by persona — powered by GPT APIs.

### Purpose  
This project started as an experiment to explore how generative AI can support real-world marketing teams.  
The goal: create a lightweight co-pilot that helps marketers brainstorm campaign ideas, test creative variations, and tailor messaging for different audiences — quickly and intelligently.  

### What It Does  
- Accepts a short product brief or value proposition as input  
- Generates multiple campaign ideas in varying tones (professional, conversational, data-driven, etc.)  
- Suggests audience-specific insights to refine targeting and positioning  
- Lets users export or copy results for A/B testing or team review  

### Example Prompt  
> “Create three LinkedIn ad headlines for an AI-driven healthcare analytics platform.  
> Tone: Confident. Audience: Pharma CMOs.”  

### Sample Output  
1. *Transform Your Data Into Discovery.*  
2. *Predict Tomorrow’s Breakthroughs, Today.*  
3. *AI That Accelerates Clinical Insight.*  

### Tech Stack  
- **Python** for logic and API integration  
- **OpenAI API** for text generation  
- **Streamlit** (optional) for a simple interactive interface  

### Why I Built It  
I’ve spent much of my career at the intersection of AI, marketing, and business growth — leading teams at Amazon, Salesforce, and Genentech to use technology for smarter storytelling and faster outcomes.  
This project is a small step toward the same vision: using AI to boost creativity, free up time, and help teams focus on strategy and insight rather than repetitive content work.  

### Next Steps  
- Experiment with fine-tuned prompts for different industries  
- Add analytics tracking to see which copy versions perform best  
- Explore integration with CRM or campaign tools for real-time testing
